\section{Introduction}

This appendix contains the cut-content of chapter~\ref{ch:literature-review}, serving now as complementary material. In the first section we show an extensive survey on traffic generator tools, and on the second, some use-cases of traffic-generators validation.

\section{Traffic generator tools}


In this section, we present a short review of many open-source tools available for synthetic traffic generation and benchmark. The aim in this section is to present the most mentioned tools in the literature and the most recent and advanced ones. On tables are presented a survey of the main features of such tools. Some free, but not open-source traffic generators are listed as well. Before present our survey, we refer to some tools mentioned in the literature, but we could not find source code and manual. 

\textbf{BRUNO}\cite{bruno-paper} is traffic generator implemented aiming performance and accuracy on timings. It has many configurable parameters that allow emulation of many web server scenarios. \textbf{Divide and conquer}\cite{validate-trafficgen}: is a replay engine that works in a distributed manner. It can split traces among multiple commodity PCs, and reply packets, to produce realistic traffic. 

Some others mentioned tools \cite{web-ditg} we were not able to find any reference of available features are: \textbf{UDPgen}, \textbf{Network Traffic Generator}, \textbf{Packet Shell}, \textbf{Real-Time Voice Traffic Generator}, \textbf{PIM-SM Protocol Independent Multicast Packet Generator}, \textbf{TTCP}, \textbf{SPAK, Packet Generator}, \textbf{TfGen}, \textbf{TrafGen} and \textbf{Mtools}. Table ~\ref{tab:traffic-gen-links} presents an updated list of links for download.

\subsection{Traffic Generators - Feature Survey}


Tables ~\ref{tab:packet-level-tg1}, ~\ref{tab:multi-level-tg2}, ~\ref{tab:app-level-tg3}, and ~\ref{tab:replay-tg1} is presented a survey of of the main features of such tools, such as support for Operational systems, protocols, stochastic functions available for traffic generation, and traffic generator class. Some free, but not open-source, traffic generators are listed as well.

\section{Validation of Ethernet traffic generators: some use cases}




In this section, we list some use cases of validation of Ethernet traffic generators. Our validation methods used in chapter 4 and 5 were based on them. We are going to present seven different study cases on validation of related traffic generators. They are Swing,   Harpoon [Sommers et al. 2004], D-ITG [Botta et al. 2012], sourcesOnOff  [Varet2014], MoonGen [Emmerich et al.2015], LegoTG [Bartlett e Mirkovic2015] and NFPA [Csikor et al. 2015].

\subsection{Swing}

Swing\cite{swing-paper} is at present, one of the primary references of realistic traffic generation. The authors extracted bidirectional metrics from a network link of synthetic traces. Their goals were to get realism, responsiveness, and randomness. They define realism as a trace that reflects the following characteristics of the original:

Packet inter-arrival rate and burstiness across many time scales;
\begin{itemize}
\item Packet size distributions;
\item Flow characteristics as arrival rate and length distributions;
\item Destination IPs and port distributions.
\end{itemize}

The traffic generator uses a structural model the account interactions between many layers of the network stack. Each layer has many control variables, which is randomly generated by a stochastic process. They begin the parameterization, classifying \cite{web-libpcap} \textit{pcap} files with the data; they can estimate parameters.

They validate the results using public available traffic traces, from \cite{web-mawi} and CAIDA\cite{web-caida}. On the paper, the authors focuses on  the validation metrics below:

\begin{itemize}
\item Comparison of estimated parameters of the original and swing generated traces;
\item Comparison of aggregate and per-application bandwidth and packets per seconds;
\item QoS metrics such as two-way delay and loss rates;
\item Scaling analysis, via Energy multiresolution energy analysis.
\end{itemize}

To the vast majority of the results, both original and swing traces results were close to each other. Thus, Swing was able to match aggregate and burstiness metrics, per byte and per packet, across many timescales.

\subsection{Harpoon}

Harpoon\cite{harpoon-validation}\cite{harpoon-paper} is a traffic generator able to generate representative traffic at IP flow level. It can generate TCP and IP with the same byte, packet, temporal and spatial characteristics measured at routers. Also, Harpoon is a self-configurable tool, since it automatically extracts parameters from network traces. It estimates some parameters from original traffic trace: file sizes, inter-connection times, source and destination IP addresses, and the number of active sessions. 

As proof of concept \cite{harpoon-validation}, the authors compared statistics from the original, and harpoon’s generated traces. The two main types of comparisons: diurnal throughput, and stochastic variable CDF and frequency distributions. Diurnal throughput refers to the average bandwidth variation within a day period. In a usual network, during the day the bandwidth consumption is larger than the night. Also, they compared:

\begin{itemize}
\item CDF of bytes transferred per 10 minutes
\item CDF of packets transferred per 10 minutes
\item CDF of inter-connection time
\item CDF of file size
\item CDF of flow arrivals per 1 hour
\item Destination IP address frequency
\end{itemize}

In the end, they showed the differences in throughput evaluation of a Cisco 6509 switch/router using Harpoon and a constant rate traffic generator. Harpoon was proven able to give close CDFs, frequency and diurnal throughput plots compared to the original traces. Also, the results demonstrated that Harpoon provides a more variable load on routers, compared to constant rate traffic. It indicates the importance of using realistic traffic traces on the evaluation of equipment and technologies.

\subsection{D-ITG}


D-ITG\cite{ditg-paper} is a network traffic generator, with many configurable features. The tool provides a platform that meets many emerging requirements for a realistic traffic generation. For example, multi-platform, support of many protocols, distributed operation, sending/receiving flow scalability, generation models, and analytical model based generation high bit/packet rate. You can see different analytical and models and protocols supported by D-ITG at table~\ref{tab:packet-level-tg1}.

To the evaluation of realism on analytical model parameterization of D-ITG, the authors used a synthetic replication of a eight players's LAN party of Age of Mythology\footnote{\href{https://www.ageofempires.com/games/aom/}{https://www.ageofempires.com/games/aom/}}. They have captured traffic flows during the party,  then, they modeled its packet size and inter-packet time distributions. They show that the synthetic traffic and the analytical model have similar curves of packet size and inter-packet time; thus it can approximate the empirical data. Also, the bit rate's mean and the standard deviation of the empirical and synthetic data are similar.

\subsection{sourcesOnOff}

Varet et al.\cite{sourcesonoff-paper} create an application implemented in C, called SourcesOnOff. It models the activity interval of packet trains using probabilistic distributions. To choose the best stochastic model, the authors had captured traffic traces using TCPdump. Then the developed tool that could configure out what distribution (Weibull, Pareto, Exponential, Gaussian, etc.) is better to the original traffic traces. They used the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) for distance assessment and tested the smaller BIC for each distribution, insuring a good correlation between the original and generated traces and self-similarity.  

The validation methods used on sourcesOnOff are:

\begin{itemize}
\item A visual comparison between On time and Off time of the original trace and the stochastic fitting;
\item QQplots, which aim to evaluate the correlation between inter-trains duration of real and generated traffic;
\item Measurement of the measured throughput's autocorrelation~\ref{ap:revision-probability} of the real and synthetic traffic;
\item Hurst exponent computation of the real and the synthetic trace;
\end{itemize}

The results pointed to an excellent stochastic fitting, better for On-time values. On the other hand, the correlation value of the QQplot was more significant on the Off time values (99.8\% versus 97.9\%). In the real and synthetic traces, the throughput's autocorrelation  remained between an upper limit of 5\%. Finally, the ratio between the evaluated Hurst exponent always remained smaller than 12%.

\subsection{MoonGen}

MoonGen\cite{moongen-paper} is a high-speed scriptable paper capable of saturating 10 GnE link with 64 bytes packets, using a single CPU core. The authors built it over DPDK and LuaJit, enabling the user to have high flexibility on the crafting of each packet, through Lua scripts. It has multi-core support and runs on commodity server hardware. MoonGen also can test latency with sub-microsecond precision and accuracy, using hardware timestamping of modern NICs cards. The Lua scripting API enable the implementation and high customization along with high-speed. This includes the controlling of packet sizes and inter-departure times. 

The authors evaluated this traffic generator focused on throughput metrics, rather than others. Also, they have small packet sizes (64 bytes to 256), since the per-packet costs dominate. In their work, they were able to surpass 15 Gbit/s with an XL71040GbENIC. Also, they achieve throughput values close to the line rate with packets of 128 bytes, and 2CPU cores.

\subsection{LegoTG}

Bartlett et al.\cite{legotg-paper} implemented a modular framework for composing custom traffic generation, called LegoTG. As argued by the authors (and by our present work), automation of many aspects of traffic generation is a desirable feature. The process of how to generate proper background traffic may become research by itself. Traffic generators available today offer a single model and a restricted set of features into a single code base, makes customization difficult. 

The primary purpose of their experiment was to show how LegoTG could generate background traffic, only. Also, they showed how realistic background traffic could influence research conclusions. The test chosen is one of the use cases proposed for Swing\cite{background-traffic-matter}, and evaluated the error on bandwidth estimation of different measurement tools. It showed that LegoTG could provide a secure and custom traffic generation.
